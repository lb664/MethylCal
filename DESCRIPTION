Description: This package allows the calibration of methylation levels
    using MethylCal, a Bayesian calibration tool based on INLA (Rue et
    al., 2009). The package permits the visualisation of the calibration 
    curve derived from standard controls with known methylation percentages
    for a selected assay. It also allows the correction of the methylation
    levels in case and control samples. If cases are provided, MethylCal
    performs a differential methylation test to detect hyper- and hypo-
    methylated samples. Besides MethylCal method, the package also 
    includes the calibration and the correction provided by two alternative
    methods (Warnecke et al., 1997; Moskalev et al., 2011).
